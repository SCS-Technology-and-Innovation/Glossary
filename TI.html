<p>Average (also known as <a href="TI.html#mean">mean</a>) is the measure of the central value of a set of numbers when arranged in a sequence. It is calculated by adding all of the numbers in the set together and then dividing by the number of items in the  set e.g (1,2,3) has the average 1+2+3/3 = 2</p>
